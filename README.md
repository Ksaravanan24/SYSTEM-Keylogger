Keylogger

Keyboard capturing is the action of recording the keys stroke on a
keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their
actions are being monitored.Whenever the user types something through the keyboard, the
keystrokes are captured and compared to an input file which is not related to the work. If
the condition is satisfied then it generates a report and is mailed to the mail id of admin
without the knowledge of the user within the time set.

you should create a workfile.txt

workfile.txt should contain word that not related to work on the system.
